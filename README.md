## Overview  
**PathFinderVisualizer** is an interactive web application developed using pure JavaScript that visualizes various pathfinding algorithms. This tool enables users to experiment with custom mazes, explore algorithmic behavior, and gain a deeper understanding of how pathfinding works in real-time.  

## Features  
- **Interactive Design:**  
  - Draw walls, set start and end points with ease.  
  - Create custom mazes or randomly generate one.  

- **Algorithm Visualization:**  
  - Visualize popular pathfinding algorithms such as:  
    - Dijkstra's Algorithm  
    - A* (A-Star) Algorithm  
    - Breadth-First Search (BFS)  
    - Depth-First Search (DFS)  

- **Dynamic Customization:**  
  - Adjust visualization speed to enhance learning.  
  - Observe how algorithms navigate around obstacles and find the shortest path.  

- **Responsive and Lightweight:**  
  - Fully responsive for desktop and mobile devices.  
  - Built using pure JavaScript, HTML, and CSS for optimal performance.  

## Technologies Used  
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- **Logic:** JavaScript for algorithm implementation and grid rendering.  

## How to Use  
1. Visit the live demo: [Path Finder Visualizer](https://path-explorer.netlify.app).  
2. Use the mouse to create walls by clicking and dragging on the grid.  
3. Set the **start** and **end** points by clicking on the respective nodes.  
4. Select a pathfinding algorithm from the menu.  
5. Click **"Visualize"** to start the animation.  
6. Observe how the algorithm processes and finds the shortest path.  

## Installation
